#### Created by - Jake Hanicak  - 2/13/20

###### This project was origionally made from my first self potrait on processing. It was my job to create new animated versions of the potrait, this time in P5.js and to use a keyboard interactions to have my stste machiene cycle three three emotions on the potrait which are normal state (me blowing a bubble), fancy pirate state (me wearing and eyepatch and a fancy hat), and scared in the dark state (where the screen goes black and just my eyes show up).
